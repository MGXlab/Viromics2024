title: "Identifying Viral Contigs I"
exercises: 180
questions:
- "Authors investigated 9 tools, which can be divided into three groups. What are the groups' descriptions and how do they differ?"
- "What are the True Positives, False Negatives, False Positives and True Negatives in figure 1? Why are these important for the benchmarking?"
- "In Fig 3 A,B,C, what indicates a good performace?"
- "In fig 3 D,E,F, they used TPR, FPR and AUC/ROC to evaluate how good the tools are. What are those terms? What is the main takeaway from these figures?"
- "Overall, which tools in fig 3 are better? Why do you think that is?"
- "What value does the analysis presented in fig 6 add to the benchmarking?"
- "Taking all answers above into consideration, what tool mentioned in the paper would you choose to indentify viruses and why?"
objectives:
- "Understand the concept of benchmarking"
- "Find the best tool for identifying viruses"

In this theoretical part, you will dive into a very important part of microbiome data analysis: how to choose a good tool. Several tools for identifying 
viruses are available online. Each measure different biological signals and use different algorithms and databases. To choose the best one for your project,
you should consider what you want to achieve in your research and the overall performance of the tools (such as sensitivity and specificity). If a recent tool does the same task as previously published ones, the authors should compare (or benchmark) them. Ideally, independent authors compare different tools, which is a great guide for scientists to choose a good tool.   

Today, you will work on the paper: ["Benchmarking bioinformatic virus identification tools using real‚Äêworld metagenomic data across biomes"](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03236-4), by Wu *et al* 2024. Considering the allocated time for this activity, you will probably not be able to read the entire paper. Therefore, focus on Figures 1, 3 and 6 and answer the proposed questions.
