# Identify viral contigs

In this theoretical part, you will dive into a very important issue of microbiome data analysis: how to choose a good tool. Several tools for identifying 
viruses are available online. Each measure different biological signals and use different algorithms and databases. To choose the best one for your project,
you should consider the internal methods and overall performance. If a tool that has been recently published does the same task as previously published
ones, the authors usually compare (or benchmark) it with other tools. Sometimes, independent authors compare different tools, which guides scientists to
choose the best possible tool.   

Today, you will work on the paper: ["Benchmarking bioinformatic virus identification tools using real‚Äêworld metagenomic data across biomes"](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03236-4), 
Wu *at al* 2024. Considering the allocated time, you will probably not be able to read the entire paper and answer the proposed questions. Therefore, focus 
on Figures 1, 3 and 6 of the paper.
