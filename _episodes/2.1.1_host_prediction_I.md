## Host prediction lecture

Listen to lecture by Varada and Malte (pay attention!!!)

> ## Exercise
> 1. What are some biological interactions viruses have with their hosts? (*hint: start with the infection cycle*)
>
> {:start='2'}
> Pick one classical host prediction method:
> 2. In brief, explain how this works
> 3. What is the major challenge with this method?
> 4. How can you be confident in your host prediction?
> 5. Evaluate the following scenarios:
>    a) Two viral contigs match to the same host during the host prediction
>    b) One viral contig matches 2 hosts: [s__Salinibacter ruber](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/tree?r=s__Salinibacter%20ruber) and [s__Longimonas halophila](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/tree?r=s__Longimonas%20halophila)

For the hands-on part - we will be using a tool called RaFAH. Have a look into 
the [RaFAH paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001008?via%3Dihub) 
and focus on the introduction and Figures 1 and 2.  

This tool uses random forest model machine learning models to predict hosts for phages. They train 
the ML model using manually curated classical host predictions (CRISPR sequences, tRNA and homology based matches). 


> ## Questions
> {:start='6'}
> 6. Briefly discribe how RaFAH derives its predictions from a genome sequence.
>
> RaFAH produces a probability score for each host genus in its training set and reports the genus with
> the maximum probability. In Figure 2, you can find how this score relates to precision and recall
> for the test dataset the authors used.
> 
> {:start='7'}
> 7. Decide, which probability score you would use as a cutoff for predictions you would trust. Explain your decision.
