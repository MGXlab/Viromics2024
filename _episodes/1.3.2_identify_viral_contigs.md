# Identify viral contigs

In this experimental part, you will identify viral contigs, assess genome completeness andfilter only high quality ones to use for subsequent analysis.  

Before running Jaeger  
- (virome and metagenome (pre-assembled) should be in dir /path/to/dir
- virome (small size fraction) and metagenome (larger size fraction)

- Where do you expect the most hits? (Before running tool)

Run Jaeger
- Add command line

After running Jaegar
Questions to think about
      - Take the longest contig from each dataset and blast it
      - Plot from jaegar score per genome length?
      - How many viral contigs are there in each assembly?
      - Why are not all contigs in the virome identified as viral contigs?
      - Why are viral contigs also identified in the metagenome?
      - size differences between viral and non-viral contigs
        
    - How would you rank Jaeger compared to other virus detection tools? (After running tool)

Check completeness with CheckV
