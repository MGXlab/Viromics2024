Answer the following questions:  

- What is metagenomics?
- What is viromics?
- What are bacteriophages? How do they fit into metagenomics?
- How do you asses the viromic community of a biological sample?
- Describe FASTA and FASTQ formats

Objectives:

- Understand what is a metagenomics study
- Understand what are bacteriophages and how they relate to prokaryotic communities
- Understand specifics of sequencing applied to the study of viromics data
- Understand FASTA and FATSQ file formats
- Understand diversity in microbial and viral communities
