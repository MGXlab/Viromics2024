# Gene Finding

After assembling virome contigs and filtering the phage ones, you will annotate them using [Phanotate](https://github.com/deprekate/PHANOTATE). Check their GITHub page to know what to expect when running it.

> What file formats can Phanotate produce? Describe them.

We ask you to produce two different outputs with Phanotate, one GFF containing the ORF coordinates and one FASTA containing the corresponding aminoacid sequences. Create sbatch scripts for running Phanotate.

> ## exercise
>
> Run Phanotate for your viral contigs to produce a GFF file and a FASTA file:
> 
>```bash
> source /home/groups/VEO/tools/phanotate/v1.5.0/myenv/bin/activate
> phanotate.py <input> -o output.gff -f gff
> phanotate.py <input> -o output.faa -f faa
>```
>
> inspect and interpret the output following the tool's webpage
>   
>```bash
> head <output>
>```
> {: .source}
{: .challenge}

After running the tool, answer the following questions in your lab book. 

> ## discussion
> 
> What does the output file look like for your data?
> 
> How many ORFs did the tool predict per contig?
>
> What is the longest ORF per contig?
>
> Did you find any overlapping ORFs in a contig?
>
> Compare Phanotate's results with CheckV's. How many overlapping genes? How many unique per tool?
