# Gene Finding

After assembling phage genomes, you will annotate them using [Phanotate](https://github.com/deprekate/PHANOTATE).  

> ## exercise
>
> Run Phanotate to your viral contigs:
> - read and interpret the output following the tool's webpage
> 
>```bash
> source /home/groups/VEO/tools/phanotate/v1.5.0/myenv/bin/activate && phanotate.py -h
> phanotate.py ?
>```
>
> - inspect the output
>   
>```bash
> head <output>
>```
> {: .source}
{: .challenge}

After running the tool, answer the following questions in your lab book. 

> ## discussion
> 
> What does the output file look like?
> 
> How many ORFs did the predict predict?
>
> What is the longest ORF?
>
> Did you find any overlapping ORFs in a contig?
>
> Optional: find similar contigs with a clustering method: AAI ?
