To close off this course, we would like to give you the opportunity to design your own research project. 
A research question does not have to be very profound, it can be simple. 
Viromics is a new field, the virosphere is huge, and there is a LOT of data, so there are more unanswered than answered questions. 
Looking back on the course, are there things you are wondering about? 
You can also look in literature for inspiration. 
Here are a few recent papers that caught our eye, maybe they inspire you (feel free to find other papers too): 
- [A highly abundant bacteriophage discovered in the unknown sequences of human faecal metagenomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5498), by Dutilh *et al* (2014)
- [Bacteriophage evolution differs by host, lifestyle and genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2017112), by Mavrich and Hatfull (2017)
- [Evolution of BACON Domain Tandem Repeats in crAssphage and Novel Gut Bacteriophage Lineages](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/12/1085), by de Jonge *et al* (2019)
- [Virus Bioinformatics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128145159000345), by Pappas *et al* (2021)
- [High viral abundance and low diversity are associated with increased CRISPR-Cas prevalence across microbial ecosystems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221014615), by Meaden *et al* (2022)
- [Viruses interact with hosts that span distantly related microbial domains in dense hydrothermal mats](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01347-5), by Hwang *et al* (2023)

> ## Exercise
> 1. Once you have an idea of a research question, take some time to talk about your idea with your fellow students.
>    Often your initial idea can be further refined based on discussions with others.
> 2. Make sure you check the literature: are there any papers that do something related to your question?
>    Find the three papers that are the most closely related to your project, and use them to refine your question.
> 3. Make a plan for tackling your question(s).
>    The more detail you can add, the better.
>    Think about data sources, bioinformatic methods, possible outcomes, expectations, backup/follow-up plans, hypotheses, and interpretation.
