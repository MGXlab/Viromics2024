# Research Question

When thinking of a new project and proposing scientific questions, the first step is to go to the scientific literature. You will get acquainted to the body of knowledge of that specific field and notice limitations. Based on this you can think of your own questions. Use (one of) the articles below (or chose one yourself) as inspiration to create your own research question(s).
