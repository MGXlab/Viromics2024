## Introduction

In this module you will learn how to analyse bacteriophage sequences with computational approaches. The theoretical part will be covered in the mornings and include discussions. Document any questions and discussion in your lab book. This will also be considered towards your final grade.

The final evaluation comprises:

- Performance in the dry lab (participation, questions, asking for help and helping others) + lab journal (60%)
- Presentation of a final project (40%)

## Lab Book

Documenting your work is crucial in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. This way you can make sure your work is reproducible, you can transfer text to other documents, such as reports or papers and you can send it to colleagues, so that they can access your work.   

You are required to write a Lab Book in **markdown** for this module, which will count as part of your evaluation. If you want, you can start a GITHub repository for the course and write your lab book there.

Start your lab book today and send a copy of it to your instructor on the last day.

> ## Some *strong* suggestions on writing a good lab book:
> 
> - Document your work and tasks everyday
> 
> - Structure it in a chronological order; each section = new day
>     - Adding sections for specific tasks like "01_Evaluating sequence quality"
>     - Use meaningful and descriptive titles
>     
> - Using a logical order for folder and file names (use structure made by instructors)
> 
> - Include relevant websites, folders where you can find files, tools (names, links, versions) and references
>

The paper "[Ten Simple Rules for a Computational Biologist’s Laboratory Notebook](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385)", by Santiago Schnell of 2015 offers interesting insights:  Most relevant are rules 4, 6 and 10. Keeping a hard copy of your lab book is not necessary, however make sure you have it backed up.
