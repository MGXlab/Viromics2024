title: Introduction to viromics
teaching: 60
exercises: 60
questions: 

objectives:
    - Summarize metagenomics and viromics
    - Understand what are bacteriophages and how they fit into microbial communities
    - Compare and contrast microbial and viral diversity
keypoints:
    - Viromics is the study of viruses, and in our case bacteriophages, using next-generation sequencing technologies
    - Bacteriophages are diverse and ubiquitous across all biomes
    - Bacteriophages have large implications on their environment including the human gut

## Video on viral metagenomics

Below is a lecture video introducing the concepts of metagenomics, microbial dark matter, and viromics. The case study covered in the video is about [crAssphage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrAssphage), a type of bacteriophage that was first found using bioinformatics, by reanalyzing viromics data from the human gut by using the cross-assembly approach. The prevalence and implications of crAssphage are also discussed.

> ## Exercise - mindmap
> Create a mindmap summarizing the following points from the video.
> _A [mindmap](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=mindmap%20) is a brainstorming graphic. You can get creative using PowerPoint or draw it on paper, take a picture, and upload it into your Lab Notebook._
> 
> 1. What is metagenomics?
