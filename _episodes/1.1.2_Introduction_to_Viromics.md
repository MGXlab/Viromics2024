## Video on Viral Metagenomics

Below is a video by Prof. Bas Dutilh introducing the concepts of metagenomics, microbial dark matter and viromics. The case study covered in the video is about crAssphage - a type of phage found by the cross assembling human gut metagenomes. The prevalence and implications of crAssphage are also discussed.

> ## Exercise
> Create a mindmap (graphic) summarizing the following points from the video.  
> A mindmap is a brainstorming graphic - you can get creative using powerpoint or draw it and take a pic to upload into your lab books. *Google "mindmap" to get an idea of what this is*
