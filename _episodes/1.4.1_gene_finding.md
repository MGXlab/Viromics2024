# Algorithms and Strategies for Finding Genes in Phages

The process of genome annotation should be tailored to the organism of study. Phages have features in their genomes and evolutionary processes that are important to keep in mind. The [video of Dr Robert Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecJ1DqVvuFE&pp=ygUJcGhhbm90YXRl) explains these and how they were taken into account when developing an annotation tool for phages. Watch it to answer the questions of this tutorial. The links of [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) and [Phanotate](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4537/5480131) are also useful for answering the questions.

As additional material, the video of [Dr Katelyn McNair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvnPsA1S6GY&pp=ygUJcGhhbm90YXRl) contains explanations of the algorithm of Phanotate. Topics are similar to the video of Dr Robert Edwards, but more detailed regarding rules and scoring. The video of [Dr Evelien Adriaenssens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO1w1Z1Or1w&pp=ygUJcGhhbm90YXRl), from 12 min 06 sec to 29 min 57 sec, contain interesting information about the structure of the phage genomes and how to best annotate them.
