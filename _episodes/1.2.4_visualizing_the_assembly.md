# Visualizing the assembly

As a homework, you can choose one of the following two topics. Pick what sounds more
interesting to you and if you find the time during the rest of the course, discuss your 
results with someone in the course who picked the other topic. (Bandage is difficult to
run on Windows)

## Effect of k-mer size

The choice of the size of k-mer has a great impact on the final assembly. When running
SPAdes, you might have noticed it doesn't use a single k-mer size per assembly but
rather a range of k-mer sizes (21, 33 and 55 in this case), where each subsequent
graph is built on the previous one. This is what they call a __multisized de Bruijn graph__.
which benefits from the high connectivity of small k-mer sizes and the simplicity of
the large ones. From [Bankevich et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342519/),
_smaller values of k collapse more repeats together, making the graph more tangled.
Larger values of k may fail to detect overlaps between reads, particularly in low
coverage regions, making the graph more fragmented. [...] Ideally, one should use
smaller values of k in low-coverage regions (to reduce fragmentation) and larger
values of k in high-coverage regions (to reduce repeat collapsing). The multisized
de Bruijn graph allows us to vary k in this manner_.

Recall that k-mer size indicates the amount of overlap (k-1) that is necessary to
perform the junction in the de Bruijn graph. The longer the k-mer is, the longer stretch
of correct nucleotides are necessary to perform such junction. Knowing this, **which
k-mer sizes (small or large) are more affected by sequencing errors? Explain why.**

We will use the [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage) tool to visualize
the graph. In the [releases](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage/releases/) section,
follow instructions to download the most appropriate version. If you are in attending
the workshop live, download `Bandage_Ubuntu-x86-64_v0.9.0_AppImage.zip`).
To run it, unzip the file, open a new terminal tab (Ctrl + Shift + t), activate the conda
environment for today, and call Bandage from the terminal like this:

~~~
# run Bandage
$ ./Bandage_Ubuntu-x86-64_v0.9.0.AppImage
~~~
{: .language-bash}

In _File > Load_graph_, navigate to any of the per sample assemblies and load
`assembly_graph.fastg` for the k-mer size 21. Then click _Draw graph_ to see the
graph. Note well this graph has been already compacted by collapsing those nodes
that form linear, unbranched paths (click any large node to see how its length is
way larger than 21, the k-mer size). Without closing the Bandage window, open a new
terminal tab and run Bandage again to load the graph for the k-mer size 55. Answer
questions below:

- Why do we expect the graph to be very tangled with small k-mer sizes such as the K21?
- K55 graph seems easier to traverse, but note well this graph has been constructed
using information from previous k-mers too. Can you think of any disadvantage of
using only a large k-mer size to construct the graph? Would you expect high or low
connnectivity?


## Effect of related species

Often in metagenomic samples, a number of strains for a given species are present,
and this is particularly evident with viral communities that typically contain an
abundance of haplotypes (or quasispecies). Because of the high amount of homologous
regions between these strains, the assembly graph is complex as multiple genomes
occupy much of the same kmer space. The convergence-divergence structure in the graph
generated by these homologous regions make traversing the graph more complex, and
mistakes at this point can lead to chimeric contigs containing sequence from more
than one strain. To visualize this effect, we will align the reads in our samples
back to the contigs that were assembled and use [jbrowse2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/download/)
to visualize the differences bettween reads and assembly.
