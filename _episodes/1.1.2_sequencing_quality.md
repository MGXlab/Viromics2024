Copy viromics sequences following the teacher's directions. These will be used in your project.        

Answer the questions below using bash. Useful bash commands, by Varada Khot, can be found here: https://github.com/vmkhot/useful-scripts/blob/main/Linux%20Commands%20Cheat%20Sheet.md  

- how many lines does your FASTQ file has?
- how many sequences are there in your FASTQ file?
- Print the first 10 lines of your file in the terminal
- Print the last 10 lines of your file in the terminal
- Describe what you see in these lines and what they mean
- What is the GC content of your files?
- Create a plot of frequency (y-axis) versus GC content (x-axis) and describe the distribution. Use python (seaborn distplot, matplotlib hist) or R (hist or ggplot geom_hist)
- Evaluate the sequence quality following: https://github.com/vmkhot/Metagenome-workflows/blob/main/Nanopore-Long-Reads/Quality%20Control.md

### What Else Might We Use A Spoiler For?

- including a collapsed version of a very long block of output/a large image from a code block,
  which the learner can expand if they want to check their output against the lesson
- a reminder of some important concept/information required to follow the lesson,
  that you expect only some learners will need to read
- wrapping a set of optional exercises for an episode
