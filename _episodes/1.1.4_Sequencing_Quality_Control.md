- Nanopore sequencing quality https://help.nanoporetech.com/en/articles/6629615-where-can-i-find-out-more-about-quality-scores
- Run Nanoplot on your sequencing data
    - play around with the features
    - Use fastq files and summary.txt
    - Assess the sequencing quality for each sample
- Do we need to filter any reads?
- Filter reads using [Chopper](https://github.com/wdecoster/chopper) 


**Sequencing Quality Questions**
- Why do we need quality control?
    - adapters and/or primers
    - low quality ends
- What is the impact of including low quality reads in downstream analyses?
- What are the metrics for assessing sequencing quality?
    - For illumina
        - phred scores
        - read quality disribution
    - for nanopore?
        - read quality 
        - read lengths
        - quality v. length
        - Do we need to remove quality reads?
