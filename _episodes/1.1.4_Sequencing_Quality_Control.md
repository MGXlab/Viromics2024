questions: []
objectives:
- Understand the value of sequencing quality control
- Discuss how low quality reads affect genomic analysis

keypoints:
- Sequencing quality control is an important first evaluation of our data
- NanoPlot can be used to evaluate read quality of long reads
- Chopper can be used to filter reads based on quality and/or length

Every step of a metagenomics/viromics analysis pipeline needs quality control and sanity checks.  
- What data am I working with?
- What is the quality of the data?
- Are my results what I expected them to be? Why?/Why not?

Here, we will assess the quality of DNA sequencing. 

Sequencing quality control can include:
- Removing barcodes
- Removing adapters
- Removing low-quality bases on read ends
- Filtering reads based on quality scores 

In reality, the Guppy/Dorado basecallers for nanopore sequencing already do quality control for us, so this is extra!

 [Nanopore sequencing quality](https://help.nanoporetech.com/en/articles/6629615-where-can-i-find-out-more-about-quality-scores)

We will use [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot?tab=readme-ov-file) to assess the quality of our reads. NanoPlot is designed for long reads and uses information in the sequence files and also the metadata files to produce plots to evaluate the quality of our reads. 

> ## Exercise
>
> Run NanoPlot on your reads
> - play around with the features
> - Use fastq files and summary.txt
> - Assess the sequencing quality for each sample
> 
>```bash
> NanoPlot -t ? --plots ? --color ? --fastq barcode1.fastq.gz -o output_dir/barcode1

This is an example of a plot you might get from NanoPlot. Something like this is important to look at so that you know approximately data is going to be lost when you filter by read quality or length.

## Filtering Reads

Having high quality reads can significantly improve assemblies - particularly for error prone long reads. Many phages naturally have more frequent low-complexity regions in their genomes (low complexity region e.g. : AAAAAAA). Nanopore sequencing error generation is biased towards low-complexity regions - either falsely generating them or the exacerbating them - thereby creating artefacts in the viral genomes during assembly. 

We will use [Chopper](https://github.com/wdecoster/chopper) to filter our reads based on quality scores and length. This has two functions: 1) subsetting the reads to only work with HQ ones, 2) reducing assembly artefacts that we noticed during assembly

>## Filter your reads
> Build a sbatch script for chopper based on the following base-usage example and a for-loop for your reads
> Your filtering criteria:
> 1. minimum quality 14
> 2. minimum length 1000 bp
> 3. maximum length 40000 bp
>
>```bash
># base usage for filtering with minimum quality 10
>gunzip -c reads.fastq.gz | chopper -q 10| gzip > filtered_reads.fastq.gz
>
># check the help for the other options
>chopper -h
>```
