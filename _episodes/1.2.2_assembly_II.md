# Assembly II

In this experimental part, use the tool [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye) to assemble your reads following Varada Khot's directions [for Metagenomes](https://github.com/vmkhot/Metagenome-workflows/blob/main/Nanopore-Long-Reads/Nanopore%20Assembly.md#for-metagenomes).

- Quality of assemly: https://github.com/vmkhot/Metagenome-workflows/blob/main/Illumina-Short-Reads/Assembly.md#how-good-is-my-assembly
      
- Add questions to guide students
  - Where do you expect the longest contigs. Take into account genome size and diversity
  - Look in the files, to check format, understand output, make sense of it
  - What is the longest, shortest contig
  - BLAST online to see what it is
