## Log into Draco

You can use the following to get into Draco

```bash
ssh <fsuid>@login1.draco.uni-jena.de

# OR

ssh <fsuid>@login2.draco.uni-jena.de
```

Take a look at the file structure and files. We have given you a subset of viromics data. Some helpful commands might be

```bash
# list
ls
ll

# path to working directory
pwd

# print first 10 lines
head -10
# print last 10 lines
tail -10

# open file on terminal (press 'q' to exit less)
less
more

# count number of lines
wc -l file.txt

# search for "@" inside file 
grep "@" file.fastq
```

### 13-16 
- Get to know your sequencing data (cont.)

In this module, you will work with two unpublished datasets produced in the VEO group by Dr Xiu Jia. The data is part of her community coalescence project. Please do not use it for any purpose other than the module. For further details, please contact either Dr. Xiu Jia or Prof. Bas E. Dutilh.


**Get to know your sequencing data questions/exercises**
- Describe fastq and fasta file formats
- What information is contained in sequencing files?
    - Choose 2 (other than fasta) and describe
- How many files in your fastq files?
    - How many sequences?
- Print the first 10 and last 10 in terminal
    - Describe these lines
    - What's the difference?
- What is the GC content of your files?
    - plot frequency v. GC content
    - describe the distribution
    - seaborn: distplot, matplotlib: hist, ggplot: geom_hist
