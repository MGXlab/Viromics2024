### 12-13 lunch

### 13-16 
- Get to know your sequencing data (cont.)

In this module, you will work with two unpublished datasets produced in the VEO group by Dr Xiu Jia. The data is part of her community coalescence project. Please do not use it for any purpose other than the module. For further details, please contact either Dr. Xiu Jia or Prof. Bas E. Dutilh.


**Get to know your sequencing data questions/exercises**
- Describe fastq and fasta file formats
- What information is contained in sequencing files?
    - Choose 2 (other than fasta) and describe
- How many files in your fastq files?
    - How many sequences?
- Print the first 10 and last 10 in terminal
    - Describe these lines
    - What's the difference?
- What is the GC content of your files?
    - plot frequency v. GC content
    - describe the distribution
    - seaborn: distplot, matplotlib: hist, ggplot: geom_hist
