# A circular genome map

You will use python to visualize the genes you annotated today. The 
[pyCirclize](https://github.com/moshi4/pyCirclize) package provides tools to generate
high quality plots of genomic data in a circular layout. Check the link to the github
page to get an idea of its possibilities. To use the package, you have to install it
into your virtual environment: 

~~~
# activate the environment
$ source path/to/your/py3env/bin/activate

# install the packages we need
$ pip install pyCirclize
~~~
{: .language-bash}

You can get some examples of how to use the package [here](https://moshi4.github.io/pyCirclize/circos_plot/).
You can use first example, the circos plot of the Enterobacter Phage, and adjust it to
use the annotated ORFs you created today with phannotate and the ORFs annotated by CheckV
on the second day.
