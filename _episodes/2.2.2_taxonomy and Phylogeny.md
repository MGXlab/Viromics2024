# Taxonomy and Phylogeny

## Morning

Check out the ICTV website: https://ictv.global/

- What is ICTV?
- What is a realm?
- How many viral genera are there?

## Afternoon

VContact2, Genomad.

You should use only high quality genomes for this analysis.

- How does Genomad work?
- Strengths vs weaknesses
- Taxonomic annotation of genomes with Genomad
- How many genomes are taxonomically annotated
- Describe the output

- How does VContact2 work
- Strengths vs weaknesses
- Make a VContact2 plot
- Add predicted host to the plot
- How many genomes are taxonomically annotated
- Describe the output

# Phylogeny

- How can you make a phylogeny of viruses?
- Pros vs cons of making phylogeny with marker gene vs full genome
- Choose a marker gene to create your phylogeny: what was the most frequently annotated PHROG?
- Align your marker genes (MAFFT, clustalw, etc.)
- Use iqtree to build the tree
- Use iTOL or iroki https://www.iroki.net/ to visualize the tree
