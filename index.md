### Course Overview

This repository contains information about the advanced module "Viromics Bioinformatics" of the Masters program in Microbiology of the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena. It consists of 60 hours dry lab work to be completed in two weeks. Theory will be covered in the mornings and practice in the afternoons. We will focus on Computational Biology/Bioinformatics applied to viromes. The course will begin with an introduction to basic concepts of Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. During the two weeks we will walk our way through the analysis of a viromics dataset, starting with quality assessments of the sequencing data, followed by the assembly and identification of putative viral genomes and their annotation. The course will end with a scientific presentation of each student on the content of this course.
