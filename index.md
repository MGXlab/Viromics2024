Here you can find information about the advanced module "Viromics Bioinformatics" of the Masters program in Microbiology of the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena.

- It consists of 60 hours dry lab work to be completed in two weeks
- You will learn how to analyse bacteriophage sequences with computational approaches
- We will cover the following topics:
  - Sequencing quality control
  - Assembly of long-read sequences
  - Identifying viral contigs
  - Open reading frame (ORF) predictions
  - Gene annotation
  - Host prediction
  - Viral taxonomy and phylogeny
  - Visualizations
- At the end of the module, students will present their work
- If you do not have a solid background in linux/bash, you can follow this [self-study material](https://github.com/waltercostamb/course_viral-microbiology_2023/blob/main/study_material.md) before the start of the module
