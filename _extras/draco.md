To log in, you can use [ssh](http://sternb.gitpages.tpi.uni-jena.de/draco-101-2023-01/#15): 

```bash
# replace <fsuid> with your actual id like ab12cde

ssh <fsuid>@login1.draco.uni-jena.de
```

## Getting into Draco

### Terminal or ssh client  
You will require a terminal or an ssh client to access Draco, which is a remote server. 

#### Linux and MacOS
Lucky! You already have a terminal integrated into the OS. You can use this or can also use VSCode (see below).

#### Windows
Please switch to either a Linux or MacOS...

Just joking! You can either install the Windows Subystem for Linux (WSL) or **VScode (recommended)**
