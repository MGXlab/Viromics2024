Start your lab book today and send a copy of it to your instructor on the last day.

> ## Some *strong* suggestions on writing a good lab book:
> 
> - Document your work and tasks everyday
> 
> - Structure it in a chronological order; each section = new day
>     - Adding sections for specific tasks like "01_Evaluating sequence quality"
>     - Use meaningful and descriptive titles
>     
> - Using a logical order for folder and file names (use structure made by instructors)
> 
> - Include relevant websites, folders where you can find files, tools (names, links, versions)
> 
> - Include citations for all the papers and tools you reference in your lab book
> 
> An example can be seen [here](https://github.com/waltercostamb/course_viral-microbiology/blob/main/tutorials/lab-book.pdf)
