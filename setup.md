You will need a laptop with WIFI access configured to connect to eduroam and a VPN client installed. Additionally, you will need VS Code to access and edit files on the HPC cluster (Feel free to use your own solution. Using VS Code makes it easier for us to help you, if necessary). Here are links with explanations for setting these up:
